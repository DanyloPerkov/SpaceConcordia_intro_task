# SpaceConcordia_intro_task

This is the repository for my intro task for Space Concordia Robotics division.
This is mainly a lerning project for me to master KiCAD 6.0.
The initial sketch was created using KiCAD, with the final version being completed using EasyEDA for ease of access to parts.

The task is to create a timer with the following functions:
  - Stop button
  - Restart button
  - Buzzer controlled by the timer



An arduino, a 5V power supply as well as a buzzer are being connected to this board.

As it is an ongoing project, a final result will be posted once the PCB is assempled.
