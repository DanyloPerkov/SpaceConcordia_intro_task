# SpaceConcordia_intro_task

This is the repository for my intro task for Space Concordia Robotics devision.

The task is to create a timer with the following functions:
  - Stop button
  - Restart button
  - Buzzer controlled by the timer

An arduino, a 5V power supply as well as a buzzer are being connected to this board.
